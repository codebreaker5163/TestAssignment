## iOS Developer Test Assignment

As requested, hereâ€™s my completed test assignment for the **iOS Developer** role.

### Features Implemented
- **Fetch popular movies** from [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/)
- **Pagination**: Starts from page 1 and loads the next page when the user performs *pull-to-refresh* on the list
- **Movie List**: Displays poster, title, rating, and release date in each row
- **Movie Details**: Tapping a movie opens a detailed view screen

### Notes
As part of the optional bonus tasks, I have implemented *pull-to-refresh*.  
Other suggested bonus features were beyond the intended scope of this test assignment for a job role. I hope this is understandable.
